# SauceWhisk

SauceWhisk provides an "ActiveRecord" style client for the [Sauce Labs](http://www.saucelabs.com) RESTful API.  If you're not using the [Sauce Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/sauce) and you want a nice way to interact with our API, give this a try.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DylanLacey/sauce_whisk.png)](https://travis-ci.org/DylanLacey/sauce_whisk)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sauce_whisk'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sauce_whisk

## Configuration

You'll need a [Sauce Labs account](http://wwww.saucelabs.com/signup).  They're free to try and, if you're an open source project, [your access is always free](http://saucelabs.com/opensauce).

Once you've got your account, set the following environment variables:

```bash
SAUCE_USERNAME=Your Sauce Username
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=Your Access Key, found on the lower left of your Account page
```

## Usage
    
### Marking jobs passed or failed
```ruby
    SauceWhisk::Jobs.pass_job job_id
    SauceWhisk::Jobs.fail_job job_id
    SauceWhisk::Jobs.change_status job_id, true_for_passed_false_for_failed
```    
    
### Creating Job Objects

There are two ways to create a Job object.  

```ruby
# Create an 'empty' job (i.e. don't retrieve job details from the API)
empty_job = Job.new job_id

# Create a job with details fetched from the API
fully_detailed_job = Jobs.fetch job_id
```

Use the first form when you just want a simple way to push details to the API.  Use the last form when you want to fetch details from the API.

NB: It's not possible to create a new job on Sauce Labs' infrastructure with the API.

### Updating Job Metadata

```ruby
job = Job.new job_id
job.build = "12.3.04-beta"
job.visibility = "public"
job.tags = "new_user"
job.name = "Determine if the User can Invite Friends"
job.custom_data = {:executor => "jparth", :team_city_config => "standard_with_instrumentation"}
job.passed = false

job.save
```

It is not possible to alter any other job properties.

### Assets

There are three types of asset for Sauce Labs jobs: screenshots, video and logs.  Assets are represented as an Asset object, which include the name, asset type and data.

#### Screenshots

```ruby
  job = Job.fetch job_id
  screenshots = job.screenshots # An array of Screenshot assets
```

#### Video

```ruby
  job = Job.fetch job_id
  video = job.video # A single Asset, holding the video
```

### Accounts

At the moment, it is only possible to query existing accounts using the API gem.

#### Retrieving a specific account
```ruby
my_account = SauceWhisk::Accounts.fetch "account_name" # Returns a SauceWhisk::Account object, with its concurrency limit
my_account = SauceWhisk::Accounts.fetch("account_name", false) # Returns a SauceWhisk::Account object, does not fetch its concurrency limit
```

`SauceWhisk::Account` objects don't do anything other then store data about the relevant account:

```ruby
my_account.username             # Sauce Labs Username
my_account.access_key           # Sauce Labs Access Key (For automated test authentication... Not your password)
my_account.minutes              # Total number of minutes available
my_account.total_concurrency    # Number of concurrent jobs allowed
my_account.mac_concurrency      # Number of concurrent Mac hosted jobs allowed (includes iPad, iPhone, Mac)
```

#### Retrieving the concurrency limits for an account

If you exceed your concurrency limits, your tests will be queued waiting for a free VM.  This may cause erroneous failures in your test cases, and no-one wants that.
```ruby
concurrencies = SauceWhisk::Accounts.concurrency_for "account_name"    # Hash containing both concurrency limits
mac_concurrency = SauceWhisk::Accounts.concurrency_for "account_name", :mac    # Fixnum of just the Mac limit
total_concurrency = SauceWhisk::Accounts.concurrency_for "account_name", :total    # Fixnum of the upper concurrency limit
```

### Tunnels

Tunnels give information about currently running [Sauce Connect](https://saucelabs.com/docs/connect) tunnels for a given user.

#### Fetching All Active Tunnels

```ruby
all_tunnels = SauceWhisk::Tunnels.all   # An array of SauceWhisk::Tunnel objects
all_tunnels_as_json = SauceWhisk::Tunnels.all(:fetch_each => false)  # An array of Tunnel IDs
```

#### Details for a specific tunnel
```ruby
tunnel = SauceWhisk::Tunnels.fetch(tunnel_id)   # An instance of Tunnel
tunnel.id        # The Tunnel, um, id.
tunnel.owner     # The Sauce Account responsible for the tunnel -- The Credentials used to open it
tunnel.status    # Whether or not the tunnel is open
tunnel.host      # The Sauce Labs machine hosting the other end of the Tunnel
tunnel.creation_time  # When the tunnel was opened, in Epoch time
```

#### Stopping a Tunnel

```ruby
tunnel = SauceWhisk::Tunnels.fetch tunnel_id
tunnel.stop  # Stops the Tunnel

SauceWhisk::Tunnels.stop tunnel_id   # Stops the tunnel with the given id
```

### Generic Sauce Labs Information

The Sauce class returns non-user-specific info about available platforms, the number of jobs run, and the status of Sauce Labs' infrastructure.

These can be used without authentication.

#### Fetch All Available Platforms

You can obtain an Array of all available webdriver platforms using `SauceWhisk::Sauce.platforms`:

```ruby
platforms = SauceWhisk::Sauce.platforms        # Fetch all platforms or return cached values
platforms = SauceWhisk::Sauce.platforms(true)  # Force a fetch of all platforms

platforms.first # => A Hash of platform details:
 
 {
    "long_name"=>"Firefox",             # Full name of the platform's browser
    "api_name"=>"firefox",              # desired_capabilities name of the platform
    "long_version"=>"20.0.1.",          # Full version number for the platform's browser
    "preferred_version"=>"",            # Preferred version of the platform's browser (If none is requested)
    "automation_backend"=>"webdriver",  # Whether this is a Webdriver or Selenium-rc driven platform
    "os"=>"Linux",                      # desired_capabilities name of the Platform's Operating System  
    "short_version"=>"20"               # desired_capabilities name of the Platform's Browsers's version
 }
```

The most important values for a platform are the **os**, **api_name**, **short_version** fields.  These are the values to use for desired_capabilites *os*, *browser* and *browser_version* respectively.

The gem does not support retrieval of selenium-rc platforms at the current time

#### Count

```ruby
all_tests = SauceWhisk::Sauce.total_job_count  # The total number of jobs ever run with Sauce Labs' help
```

#### Service Status

```ruby
status = SauceWhisk::Sauce.service_status   # Check the status of Sauce Labs' service

status.inspect # =>

{
  :wait_time=>0.39880952380952384,                          # Delay between requesting a job and it starting
  :service_operational=>true,                               # Operational Status -- Boolean
  :status_message=>"Basic service status checks passed."    # More info when erros occuring
}
```

### Logger

You can set a custom logger object, passing anything that responds to puts:

```ruby
SauceWhisk.logger = my_logger
```

SauceWhisk.logger defaults to STDOUT.
